🗄️ Learning SQL & Databases

🎓 Computer Science Student

I am currently studying database systems and building a foundation in SQL. During this semester, I’ve been learning how data is organized, connected, and queried inside relational databases.

Instead of focusing only on theory, I practice creating small databases and writing queries to solve simple real-world problems.

📘 What I’ve Learned So Far

🔹 Creating tables and defining columns
🔹 Using primary and foreign keys to connect tables
🔹 Writing basic queries (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
🔹 Filtering results with WHERE and ORDER BY
🔹 Using JOIN to combine data from multiple tables
🔹 Applying aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, and AVG

💡 What Interests Me

📊 Understanding how data relationships work
📁 Organizing information efficiently
🔍 Writing queries to extract useful insights

🎯 My Objective

To build a strong foundation in SQL and continue improving my database design and querying skills through practical projects.
